### Topic: React Hooks (useEffect, useState) + TailwindCSS

### Reading:

1. React Hooks:

- React Hooks are special functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components without writing a class. They were introduced in React 16.8 to simplify code, improve readability, and facilitate the reuse of stateful logic.

- Some popular and useful React Hooks are:
  - `useState`
  - `useEffect`
  - `useContext`
  - `useReducer`
  - `useRef`

- We will use `useEffect` and `useState` in today's lab.

  a) `useEffect`: It performs side effects (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions, manual DOM updates) in functional components.
  - check `TestUseEffect.jsx`. While testing it, comment out `<App / >` from the `main.jsx` file and add `<TestUseEffect />` instead. Notice how `useEffect` is triggered/called when the dependency (`count`) changes. -**Note:** if the dependency array is left empty, it means, the `useEffect` function will be called only once (first time DOM rendering).
